Apache beam tech tasks

## Assumptions

Based on the instructions and details given in the tech task document. I have made the following assumptions.
- I have created my own csv file based on the details given for the ease of testing.
- The csv file is named "transactions.csv" with the columns - date and transcation_amount. The date format was assumed to be "YYYY-MM-DD" as this was also mentioned in the task document.

## Work done
- I have used the created "transactions.csv" to develop solution for task 1 and task 2 in google colab as requested in the tech test. Please refer to files "task1.ipynb" and "task2.ipynb".
